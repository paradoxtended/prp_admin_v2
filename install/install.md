Hello, thanks for choosing our admin menu script.

If you have any problem with installation don't worry to ask for help on our discord.
When you first start the server with this script, the dashboard will appear "laggy" because the script doesn't have player data from the database...
However, it will work normally later.

1. Install dependencies
    - generic_texture_renderer_gfx - Copy this folder into your resources folder (used for DUI)
    - prp_lib - (https://github.com/paradoxtended/prp_lib)
    - ox_lib - (https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)
    - oxmysql - (https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql)
    - screenshot-basic - (https://github.com/citizenfx/screenshot-basic)

2. Make sure that all of the dependencies are loaded before prp_admin_v2

3. (Optional) Change logo to yours if you want so in web/build/logo.webp (It has to be in .webp and it has to be called logo !!!)

4. Restart the server and enjoy our script.
